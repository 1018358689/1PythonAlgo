# [Unique Substrings With Equal Digit Frequency][title]

## Description

Given a digit string `s`, return _the number of **unique substrings** of _`s`
_where every digit appears the same number of times._



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = "1212"    Output: 5    Explanation: The substrings that meet the requirements are "1", "2", "12", "21", "1212".    Note that although the substring "12" appears twice, it is only counted once.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = "12321"    Output: 9    Explanation: The substrings that meet the requirements are "1", "2", "3", "12", "23", "32", "21", "123", "321".    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
  * `s` consists of digits.


**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Counting, Hash Function, Rolling Hash
